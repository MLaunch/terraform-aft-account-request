# Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform

This is a companion repository for [Provision and Manage Accounts with Control Tower Account Factory]

This repository contains boilerplate configuration for defining account requests to use with the Account Factory for Terraform module. The AFT pipeline requires the structure used and the included submodule to define a DynamoDB table item with your account specifications.
